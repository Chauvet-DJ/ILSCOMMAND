## Firmware Update Instructions
1. Download the zip file onto your computer and extract the folder.
2. Transfer the contents from the zip file onto a USB thumb drive.
3. Power on the controller and let it boot up completely.
4. Go into the **Settings** menu and navigate to "**System Update**".
5. Select "**Yes**". The controller will reset and go into upload mode.
6. Insert the USB thumb drive into the USB port on the rear of the controller. The ILS command will automatically find the firmware and apply it.
7. The controller will reset itself and display the new firmware version during startup.
8. The USB thumb drive can be removed after the fixture restarts.

### Special Notes
* Do not use a thumb drive greater than 32GB.
* The thumb drive must be formatted to FAT32.
* The downloaded firmware file must be placed in the root directory on the thumb drive (no folders).
* Do not disconnect from power source until the update process is complete.
